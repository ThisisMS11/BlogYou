## What am I thinking?

So i have added the texteditor with the help of mongodb and now i am able to add blog data to our database and extract it using unique document id.
Now the task that are remaining are the following:

> 1. To display the article clicked and manage to show that article the exact same way it was created.

> 2. I have a unique id with every document that can help me out to uniquely identify my documents.

> 3. I will hide the quill toolbar and display the article editor just like the way it is visible now and that will probably do the job.

Next Work:-
Before saving any new article we are supposed to ask used for some specifications about the article like blog title ,tag, desc, thumbnai url.and using this information we will create cards for the same.
