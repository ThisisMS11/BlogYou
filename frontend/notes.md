## What am I thinking?

So i have added the texteditor with the help of mongodb and now i am able to add blog data to our database and extract it using unique document id.
Now the task that are remaining are the following:

> 1. To display the article clicked and manage to show that article the exact same way it was created.

> 2. I have a unique id with every document that can help me out to uniquely identify my documents.

> 3. I will hide the quill toolbar and display the article editor just like the way it is visible now and that will probably do the job.

Next Work:-
1. Using User info to generate access token and use it in card modal.
2. 

2. Delete and update the blogcard work. // last work to be done for sure.
1. On saving the blogcard for the blog I want to blog to be removed from the 
edit the blogcard will simply be used to edit the blog so no place for blogcard editing so far.


Future works for imprvoing the ui design:
1. 

Future works for securing the backend system:
1. only allow the credible user to edit or delete blogs and their cards by fetchuser addition in the api's.


What am i doing?
// localstorage.getitem('userinfo');
I have changed the register api call and manipulated according to response we would receive by google login and also updated the user modal everything is working find and i am excited about launching this project into production.

//! for far so good I am very happy to


//? Errors : 
1. on refreshing we will loose the tokenclient.
